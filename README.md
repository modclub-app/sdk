# MODCLUB

MODCLUB is a moderation platform for online apps deployed on the IC. Moderation as a service (MaaS) is the concept of outsourcing controversial decisions or risky content in order to protect users and maintain trust within communities.

# Usage

To integrate with MODCLUB, you need to perform the below steps:

1.  Provide your canister ID to MODCLUB team first so that it can be allowed listed.
2.  Import Modclub sdk in to your canister either using vessel(recommended) or copy pasting the src/modclub.mo file. The example provided uses `vessel` to fetch Modclub SDK for integration. This is how you set `vessel` up:

    -   follow the "getting started" instructions [here](https://github.com/dfinity/vessel#getting-started) to install and setup vessel on your machine

    -   modify your `package-set.dhall` and include the `modsdk` in your `additions`. make sure you use the latest version from the releases on github:
        ```
        let upstream = https://github.com/dfinity/vessel-package-set/releases/download/mo-0.6.21-20220215/package-set.dhall sha256:b46f30e811fe5085741be01e126629c2a55d4c3d6ebf49408fb3b4a98e37589b
        let Package =
            { name : Text, version : Text, repo : Text, dependencies : List Text }
        let additions = [
            { name = "modsdk"
            , repo = "https://github.com/modclub-app/sdk"
            , version = "0.1.1"
            , dependencies = ["base"] : List Text
            }
        ] : List Package
        in upstream # additions
        ```
    -   make sure you also add the library as a dependency to your `vessel.dhall` file like this:

        ```
        {
        dependencies = [ "base", "modsdk" ],
        compiler = Some "0.6.11"
        }
        ```

3.  Register with Modclub. You can use the following command to get the `companyLogoNat8Format` from your Logo:

    `for byte in ${(j:,:)$(od -An -v -tuC <path to your logo>)[@]}; echo "$byte"`

    Substitute `<path to your logo>` with the correct path to your Logo. Make sure you set the correct mime type for the logo as well, e.g. `imageType = "image/svg+xml"` for a SVG logo.

    ```js
    // If you are using Vessel
    import Modclub "mo:modsdk/modclub";

    // If you are using SDK after copy pasting the modclub.mo file.
    import Modclub "./modclub";

    actor {
        private env : Text = "prod"; // "qa" and "dev" are also available options, for testing purposes

        public func setup() {
            let companyLogoInNat8Format : [Nat8] = [255, 216, 255, 224, 0];
            let companyLogo : Modclub.Image = {
                data = companyLogoInNat8Format;
                imageType = "image/jpeg";
            };
            // Register with Modclub
            let _ = await Modclub.initProvider(env, "TestProviderApp", "AppDescription", ?companyLogo);
        }
    }
    ```

    > :warning: **You only need to register once**: After the registration is done you can remove the `setup` method from your canister!

### Managing Content Rules

Once registered, you can set the rules that moderators should use to evaluate if the submitted content violates those them or not.

**addRules** - Add content rules
Params:

-   _rules_ - [Text] - An array of Texts that describe your content rules
-   _providerId_ - ?Principal - Optional Canister/Provider Id for which rules need to be registered

**removeRules** - Remove existing rules
Params:

-   _ruleIds_ - [Text] - An array of Rule Ids that you would like to remove
-   _providerId_ - ?Principal - Optional Canister/Provider Id for which rules need to be removed

**getProviderRules** - Returns the list of rules caller has set up

### Registering Callback

In order for your application to be aware of when some content has been either approved or rejected, you can register a callback with MODCLUB.

**subscribe** - Suscribe your call back with MODCLUB
Params:

-   _callback_ - SubscribeMessage - The callback function you want to subscribe

The callback should have the following type

```js
  public type SubscribeMessage = { callback: shared ContentResult -> (); };
```

Example of registering your callback:

```js
  public func subscribe() : async() {
    await Modclub.getModclubActor(env).subscribe({callback = voteResult;});

  };

  public func voteResult(result: ContentResult) {
      Debug.print(debug_show(result));
  };
```

### Submitting Content

Once your app is registered you can submit content to MODCLUB to be reviewed, but first of all 
you have to ensure that your app-canister owns some MOD tokens and use following method to topUp 
your ProviderAccount on modclubPlatform:
```js
await Modclub.topUpReserveBalance(env, amount);
```
You need this cause every submitted task review has its own price to payed as royalty to moderators.

To submit content please use the following methods:

**submitText**
Params:

-   _sourceId_ - Text - The unique ID for this content on your platform.
-   _text_ - Text - The text content to be reviewed
-   _title_ (optional) - Text - An optional title for this content

```js
await Modclub.getModclubActor("staging").submitText("my_content_id", "Text content to be reviewed", ?"Title of content");
```

### Proof of Humanity

MODCLUB's POH works as follows, there are different POH challenges that dApps can choose from. For instance an NFT platform might use an audio challenge ( you recite a unique phrase ). They may also use a drawing challenge ( draw a unique set of shapes on a piece of paper ) that would be a video challenge but won't require you to show your face or anything personally identifiable. You can stack on a series of challenges if you would like which further adds to proof that the user is human but that again that is up to the dApp.

#### Current POH Challenges

-   _challenge-profile-pic_ - This challenge requires the user to submit a picture of the face using their camera or by uploading one
-   _challenge-user-video_ - This challenge requires the user to record using their camera a set of 6 random words.
-   _chalenge-user-audio_ - This challenge requires the user to record using their microphone a set of 6 random words.

To get started with Proof of Humanity you must first register your callback method to retrieve the result.

MODCLUB's proof of humanity works To setup proof of humanity you will need to first register

**_subscribePohCallback_**
This is the callback that MODCLUB will call after a user has completed their POH. Your application should handle the result of this method and perform

```js
 subscribePohCallback: (SubscribePohMessage) -> async ();
```

**_verifyHumanity_**
This method you call in order to check if a user has verified their humanity. If they haven't you will receive a token that will be used to redirect the user back to modclub to perform POH.

Parms:

-   uniqueUserId - Text - This is a unique user id that your application is aware of. This could be the principal of the user from your app or a unique string. When a user completes their POH, MODCLUB will call you callback with the users POH result along with this unique identifier.

```js
verifyHumanity: (Text) -> async PohVerificationResponsePlus;
```

#### Using POH

```js
public shared({caller}) func exampleToInitiatePOH(): async Text {
        // userId to check if they are a human or not
        let userId = "2vxsx-fae";
        // call to check humanity
        let response =  await Modclub.getModclubActor(environment).verifyHumanity(userId);

        // The user is verified and this is the first time they have associated their account on your application to their modclub POH.
        if(response.status == #verified and response.isFirstAssociation) {
           // In most cases you will only want to accept a POH response that has isFirstAssociation = true so that a user can't reuse their POH
           // with multiple accounts on your platform. For example an NFT allowlist will want the first association of an account to be accepted.
            return "User is verified and first association from your app to modclub";
        };

       // The user has been verified but is reusing their POH
       if(response.status == #verified and not response.isFirstAssociation) {
            return "User is verified but is reusing their modclub POH for another account on your platofrm";
        };

        if((response.status == #startPoh or response.status == #notSubmitted) and response.isFirstAssociation) {
            return "User hasn't done POH or hasn't submitted it. Use this token to start POH: " # Option.get(response.token, "");
        };
        if(response.status == #verified) {
            return "User is verified";
        };

        // The POH has expired in accordance with your configuration. For instance you may only accept POH that was submitted in the last 6 months
        // If the user submitted their POH 7 months ago, then you would receive a status of #expired
        if(response.status == #expired) {
            return "User's POH is expired";
        };
        return "User's POH is pending for review";
    };
```
